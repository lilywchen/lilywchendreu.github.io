Hi everyone! My first blog post!
I'm really excited to start my DREU experience with Professor Li.
I just had a first virtual group meeting and met Sebastian, a fellow student researcher at UT Austin. I also met Professor Byron Wallace.

My first steps are:
Get trialstreamer abstracts from Byron's pubmed source
Run some summarization prompts on the abstracts with REDPajama
Work towards finalizing which prompts and models to use for the generations

Excited for model generations!
