Moving to Austin, Texas soon!

Taking a bit of a break because Professors are at a conference/unavailable to meet and my research partner is traveling

I've been reading a lot more about factuality models, metrics, and frameworks published in recent years like QAFactEval, Summac, etc.

I'm happy to get a breather amongst all the generations and automatic evaluations...
