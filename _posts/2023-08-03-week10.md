My final week of the official DREU program!
Overall this summer I learned a lot more about LLMs, medical simplification, annotations, factuality, and natural language processing research in general. Furthermore, I got to collaborate with very suportive, encouraging, and helpful peers and mentors. 

Next steps:
- Figure out the annotation interface and finalize annotation instructions
- Run the full annotation study on 400 model generations
- Build a factuality model or framework with LLMs to verify the factuality
- Compare the factuality model vs human evaluation and draw conclusions

Thank you so much to Professor Jessy Li, Sebastian, Professor Byron Wallace, and Professor Wei Xu for all the feedback, mentorship, and support throughout this summer. I'm excited to continue in the Fall towards completing these steps and project and submitting to ACL!
