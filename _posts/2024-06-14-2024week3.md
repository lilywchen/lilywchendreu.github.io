title: 2024 Week 3

Third week!
As an update, I reformatted the data into a compatible json to view with Sebastian's viewer.
After reaching out and talking to Somin, who was very helpful, he suggested to use a more SOTA mebedding


The next steps include visualizing the data by converting it to a json so that I can view it with an awesome Annotation viewer Sebastian made.
I think I need to then analyze at least 20 claims and their documents to assess the relevance of the abstracts, and then gauge a sense compared to the previous baseline of using DPR and ROBERTA embeddings.

I also will have to reach out to Somin (author of RedHOT paper) about his code for the DPR baseline, and perhaps try running it myself.

Cheers to more experiments and a new week!
