title: 2024 Week 11
---

It's August 22 today, so not technically Week 11 (whoops)... But I was traveling/moving around from Texas to Bangkok for ACL and didn't get a chance to put my final blog post up.

My DREU experience is over but I'm still working on the project. I had a blast presenting at ACL (23 hour flight there) and meeting other students and professors.

My next step is collaborating with a MD who is joining our team, Ramez Kouzy, on claim curation by diseases that have sufficient amount of conducted RCT literature. Furthermore, trying to re-design the curation and retrieval to be more expert.

While this is going, analyzing agreement on our latest set of 5 claims, trying to refine the annotation expert pipeline, and further scale up to more claims.

A long way to go, but excited nonetheless.

Very grateful for an amazing DREU experience this year! ðŸ¥‚
