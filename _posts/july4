Week 6!
Happy July 4th to everyone! 🎆🎆

After eating some burgers and soaking up the sun, I have some updates on where we stand with the annotation task:
Our goal: To create a benchmark with 300 claims.
We have talked to three medical experts (MD students from the US and a professional with a MD/PhD), who might become our annotators
We also created an Upwork job listing (which 130+ people applied to), and went through some of the candidates. We found a few MDs/doctors from America, but we are planning to hopefully go forward with the three medical experts we personally sourced first, then choose from Upwork if we need more help.

The next thing I need to do is finish filtering out the additional claim data from RedHot for valid claims, and then retrieve the relevant medical abstracts, whilst working on some system benchmarks/studying synthetic data propositions for creating a system
We're hoping that we can work through the annotation in ~4 weeks:
Week 1:
Each annotator annotates 27 claims (full set of 40 doubly-annotated claims)
Week 2, 3, 4: 
Each annotator annotates 29 claims (singly-annotated)
This plan would give us a full set of 40 doubly-annotated claims and 260 singly-annotated claims within a reasonable benchmark.

The following is just trying to guide the annotation process smoothly and make more steps towards systems building and experiments.
Stay cool for the rest of July!!! 🍹🍹🍹
